[Lab 5: Binary Maze](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/cs31/s19/labs/lab05.html)

In the other three files you copied over you are going to add information about
your maze and about how you solved it:

maze_ID:

    Jiung Jung, Ghazi Randhawa. Maze 23.


soln.txt:

   List each puzzle's input solution in this file, each on a separate line.

   I'm going to use this file as input to your maze program, so make sure
   that it contains only the input needed to solve your maze (and include
   the 0 or 1 answer to the yes/no question about phase 5).
   It should work if I run your maze like this:

     ./maze soln.txt


maze_how_we_solved_it:

   Add a brief (1-2 paragraph) description how you solved each phase/puzzle of
   your maze.

   Your descriptions should be detailed enough so that it is clear how you
   figured it out, but should not enumerate every little step; you want a
   non-vague and concise explanation.

   It should include a high-level description of what you think the
   corresponding C code is doing for that phase (you do not need to translate
   to C but describe in terms of C constructions such as loops, function calls,
   conditional stmts, etc.).

   Do not list long code sequences, nor the minutia of every single step.


# Lab Assessment
